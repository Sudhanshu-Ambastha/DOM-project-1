# DOM-project-1

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods to change the appearance of a `div` element on a webpage. Using `getElementById`, we target the `div` and apply various style changes, such as background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width.
